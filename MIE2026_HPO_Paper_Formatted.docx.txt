Abstract. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is a critical resource for standardizing phenotypic descriptions of rare diseases, widely adopted in international healthcare and research systems. However, the absence of a comprehensive, validated, and culturally adapted Portuguese version significantly limits its application in Portuguese-speaking countries, which collectively serve over 280 million people. This paper introduces an innovative, gamified, and expert-driven collaborative protocol for translating and validating HPO terms at multiple levels into Portuguese, specifically designed for implementation within the Brazilian Rare Diseases Network (Rede RARAS). Our methodology integrates computational pre-processing, advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) for initial translation, and a distributed validation process involving healthcare professionals. Key enhancements include a robust gamification framework with a scoring system, tiered user levels, achievement badges, and real-time feedback mechanisms to boost engagement and motivation. Furthermore, a sophisticated ranking system based on translation quality and expert consensus, coupled with personalized recommendations derived from professional expertise, ensures high-quality output and efficient resource allocation. The proposed protocol aims to accelerate the translation process, improve the accuracy and cultural relevance of HPO terms in Portuguese, and foster a sustainable collaborative environment. We anticipate that this approach will not only bridge the linguistic gap in HPO accessibility for the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP) but also serve as a scalable model for similar biomedical ontology translation efforts, ultimately enhancing digital health literacy and diagnostic capabilities in rare diseases.

1. Introduction
The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) stands as a cornerstone in the precise and standardized description of phenotypic abnormalities associated with human diseases [1]. Developed by an international consortium, HPO currently encompasses over 18,000 terms and 156,000 annotations for hereditary diseases, meticulously curated from scientific literature and established knowledge bases such as Orphanet, DECIPHER, and OMIM [2]. Its widespread adoption in genomic diagnostics, clinical decision support systems, and rare disease research underscores its pivotal role in enhancing interoperability across global healthcare data [3,4].  Recent developments have expanded HPO to include translations in multiple languages, with the HPO browser now internationalized to support ten languages in addition to English [REF OFICIAL DO HPO].
Despite its increasing global recognition and validity, particularly within the context of rare diseases, the HPO database remains predominantly available in English. This linguistic barrier presents significant accessibility challenges for non-English-speaking regions, particularly for the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), which comprises over 280 million Portuguese speakers across diverse cultural and economic landscapes (REF). The absence of a complete, validated, and culturally adapted HPO version in Portuguese severely impedes its practical application in the healthcare and research systems of these nations, thereby undermining equitable healthcare processes for rare diseases, including diagnosis, triage, and treatment, as well as education and training initiatives (REF).
Traditional translation methodologies, while providing high quality, are often resource-intensive, time-consuming, and heavily reliant on manual human expertise [5]. Recent advances in machine translation and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising results for HPO translation, with studies showing high-quality translations comparable to expert-validated references [6]. However, human post-editing and validation remain crucial for accuracy and cultural adaptation in medical terminology translation [7].
This paper proposes a novel, comprehensive, and scalable protocol for the collaborative translation and validation of HPO terms into Portuguese. Our approach leverages the existing infrastructure of the Brazilian Rare Diseases Network (Rede RARAS) and integrates cutting-edge technologies, including large language models for initial translation. Crucially, we introduce a well-oriented gamification framework and an expert-driven validation system designed to enhance translator engagement, ensure high-quality output, and accelerate the overall translation process.
2. Methods
2.1 Protocol Overview
Our protocol for collaborative HPO translation and validation follows a systematic, scalable, and engaging multi-stage workflow that integrates automated translation with distributed collaborative validation and expert-driven quality assurance. The process comprises five iterative stages: data pre-processing and standardization, automated translation using state-of-the-art LLMs, collaborative validation through distributed review by healthcare professionals, expert validation for final quality assurance, and publication with integration into existing systems. Each stage builds upon the previous one with continuous feedback mechanisms, while gamification and ranking systems drive participation and maintain quality standards throughout the process.
The workflow is designed to optimize efficiency, linguistic accuracy, and semantic integrity within the context of rare diseases. Initial HPO terms undergo comprehensive pre-processing for data cleaning and standardization, ensuring consistency across the dataset. Subsequently, first-pass translations are generated using advanced LLMs such as GPT-4, which have demonstrated superior performance in medical terminology translation tasks [8]. This automated approach significantly accelerates the translation process while providing a robust foundation for subsequent human review and validation phases.
2.2 Collaborative Validation Platform
The collaborative validation system is operationalized through the Rede RARAS's REDCap platform, a secure, web-based system that supports custom forms and workflows for translation and validation activities [9]. This platform enables users across three distinct roles—Translators, Reviewers, and Validators—to access terms, suggest improvements, and validate translations in a structured manner. The system provides comprehensive tracking of all changes, comments, and validations, ensuring complete audit trails and version control, thereby promoting transparency and accountability throughout the translation process.
To foster engagement and maintain high-quality output, we have implemented a comprehensive gamification framework that transforms the translation and validation process into an interactive and motivating experience. The scoring and rewards system awards points for various activities, with weightings based on both quality metrics and task complexity, such as validating challenging terms or providing highly-rated suggestions that achieve consensus. These accumulated points contribute to overall user scores and unlock virtual rewards, creating positive reinforcement mechanisms that encourage continued participation and high-quality contributions.
User progression is facilitated through a tiered level system, where participants advance through distinct levels —Novice, Proficient, Expert, and Master, based on their accumulated points and accuracy metrics. Each level progression grants new privileges and responsibilities within the platform, encouraging long-term engagement and providing clear advancement pathways for contributors. Additionally, virtual badges and achievements recognize significant milestones and exceptional contributions, such as "Accuracy Ace" for maintaining high validation accuracy or "Rare Disease Champion" for extensive contributions to complex phenotypic terms, fostering a sense of accomplishment and community recognition.
2.3 Ranking and Quality Assurance System
A sophisticated ranking and reputation system ensures the quality of maintenance and assesses the reliability of contributors. Translation and validation quality are measured through both quantitative metrics, including inter-rater agreement and acceptance rates, as well as qualitative assessments through expert review and peer evaluation processes [10]. These metrics collectively contribute to individual user quality scores, which influence their standing within the community and their eligibility for advanced validation tasks.
Dynamic leaderboards display real-time rankings based on various criteria, including total points earned, number of validated terms, and accuracy percentages, fostering healthy competition while maintaining focus on quality outcomes [11]. The comprehensive reputation scoring system reflects consistent quality performance, reliability metrics, and positive community engagement, directly influencing a user's validation weight in consensus decisions and eligibility for complex or critical translation tasks.
2.4 Expert-Based Recommendation System
The expert identification and routing system ensures that critical and complex terms receive appropriate specialized attention. Experts are systematically identified through multiple criteria, including established reputation scores, declared medical specialties, and demonstrated historical performance in specific phenotypic domains. This multi-faceted approach ensures that the most qualified individuals review terms within their areas of expertise, maximizing both efficiency and accuracy in the validation process.
Complex and high-priority terms are automatically routed through the expert validation workflow, where identified domain specialists provide detailed feedback, corrections, and final approval decisions. This targeted approach ensures that challenging terminology receives appropriate specialized review while optimizing resource allocation across the translation project. Furthermore, the system generates personalized recommendations for translation and validation tasks based on individual user expertise profiles, optimizing task distribution and maintaining high engagement levels through relevant and appropriately challenging assignments.
3. Preliminary results
3.1 Pilot Implementation Results
The Initial pilot testing of our gamified collaborative translation protocol demonstrated significant improvements in both engagement metrics and translation quality outcomes. A preliminary evaluation involving XX HPO terms showed an average inter-rater agreement of XX% and a validation time of X.Y minutes per term, indicating strong consensus among validators and efficient workflow processes [12]. The gamification elements successfully increased user engagement, with participants showing sustained activity over extended periods compared to traditional translation approaches.
The scoring and progression system proved effective in motivating continued participation, with users actively pursuing higher levels and badge achievements. Quality metrics remained consistently high throughout the pilot period, indicating that gamification elements enhance, rather than compromise, translation accuracy. User feedback indicated high satisfaction with the platform's interactive features and clear progression pathways, with XX% of participants expressing willingness to continue their involvement in the full-scale implementation.
3.2 Quality Assessment and Validation Metrics
A broader quality assessment revealed that our hybrid approach, which combines LLM-generated initial translations with collaborative validation, achieved superior results compared to purely automated or manual translation methods. The multi-tier validation system successfully identified and corrected terminology inconsistencies while maintaining cultural adaptation appropriate for Portuguese-speaking healthcare contexts. Expert validators provided critical refinements for complex phenotypic terms, ensuring medical accuracy and clinical relevance across diverse specialties.
The ranking system effectively identified high-performing validators, with top-ranked contributors demonstrating consistently superior accuracy rates and providing valuable feedback that improved overall translation quality. Consensus-building mechanisms facilitated the resolution of translation disagreements, with the majority of disputed terms achieving satisfactory resolution through collaborative discussion and expert input.
3.3 System Performance and Scalability
Platform performance metrics indicated robust scalability potential for full HPO translation implementation. The REDCap-based infrastructure demonstrated stable performance under increased user loads, with response times remaining within acceptable limits during peak usage periods. Automated workflow components successfully managed task distribution and progress tracking, requiring minimal manual intervention, which indicates strong operational efficiency.
User onboarding and training processes proved effective, with new participants achieving productive contribution levels within minimal orientation periods. The gamification framework maintained user engagement across diverse participant backgrounds, from medical students to experienced clinicians, demonstrating broad applicability across the intended user base.
4. Discussion
4.1 Advantages of Gamified Collaborative Translation
Our gamified approach to HPO translation offers significant advantages over traditional methodologies in terms of scalability, engagement, and quality maintenance. The integration of game-like elements successfully transforms what might otherwise be tedious translation work into an engaging and rewarding activity that sustains long-term participant involvement [13]. This approach addresses one of the primary challenges in large-scale collaborative projects: maintaining consistent contributor engagement throughout extended project timelines.
The multi-tiered validation system ensures quality control while distributing workload efficiently across available human resources. By combining automated initial translations with structured human validation, our protocol achieves the speed benefits of machine translation while maintaining the accuracy and cultural sensitivity that only human experts can provide [14]. This hybrid approach represents a significant advancement over purely manual translation methods, which are often unsustainable for large-scale ontologies, such as HPO.
4.2 Implications for Rare Disease Research
The successful implementation of this protocol will have profound implications for rare disease research and clinical practice across Portuguese-speaking countries. Access to a high-quality, validated Portuguese HPO will enable more accurate phenotypic descriptions in clinical settings, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and facilitating international research collaboration [15]. The standardized terminology will support the development of clinical decision support systems and genomic diagnostic tools adapted for Portuguese-speaking populations.
Furthermore, the collaborative nature of our approach fosters community building within the rare disease research community, creating networks of expertise that extend beyond the immediate translation project. These connections can facilitate future collaborative research initiatives and knowledge-sharing activities that benefit the broader rare disease community in the CPLP region.
4.3 Challenges and Limitations
Despite its advantages, our approach faces several challenges that require ongoing attention and refinement. Ensuring consistent quality across a large, distributed group of contributors requires sophisticated quality control mechanisms and continuous monitoring systems. The initial setup and ongoing maintenance of the gamification platform demand significant technical expertise and computational resources, which may limit adoption in resource-constrained settings.
Cultural and regional variations within the Portuguese-speaking community introduce additional complexity, as terminology preferences may vary across different countries and regions. Our protocol addresses this through expert validation workflows and community consensus mechanisms, but ongoing attention to regional variations will be necessary for optimal cultural adaptation.
5. Conclusions
This paper presents a novel and comprehensive protocol for collaborative HPO translation, successfully integrating advanced technology with human expertise through innovative gamification and expert validation mechanisms. Our approach addresses critical challenges in biomedical ontology localization while fostering sustainable collaborative communities that extend beyond individual translation projects.
The gamified collaborative framework demonstrates significant potential for accelerating high-quality translation of complex medical terminologies while maintaining rigorous quality standards. By leveraging the established infrastructure of Rede RARAS and incorporating intelligent task allocation based on professional expertise, our protocol offers a scalable and efficient solution for localizing biomedical ontologies in Portuguese-speaking countries.
The successful implementation of this protocol will substantially improve HPO accessibility for over 280 million Portuguese speakers, potentially enhancing diagnostic accuracy, facilitating international research collaboration, and supporting the development of culturally adapted digital health tools. Beyond its immediate impact, this work establishes a replicable model for collaborative biomedical terminology translation that can be adapted for other languages and ontologies, contributing to global efforts to democratize access to critical medical knowledge and improve healthcare equity across diverse linguistic communities.
